Append-only log of Builder iterations.

## 2026-10-09T11:50:27Z — iteration

- Oriented in the required order: roadmap, initial STATUS, HARNESS, absence of M0
  review folder, and absence of AGENTS/ADRs. Harness contains two run-start messages
  and no failed checks or refused reviews. Current branch is autopilot/20261009-2242.
- Read the phase-0 brief and protected check script. Kept this iteration inside M0
  research, and did not run review.sh or create harness-owned review/gate files.
- Built the scaffold: README, AGENTS roles/protocol, official Apache-2.0 LICENSE,
  project brief, initial glossary, data-layout/setup documentation, research/ML/app
  purpose READMEs, ADR template, M0 review README, and ignore rules for data, model
  weights, secrets, research caches, virtualenvs and builds.
- Accepted ADR-003 (code licence) under autopilot authority, pending human review.
  Kept all of data/ ignored; documented its layout in docs/DATA-LAYOUT.md instead
  of force-adding a README from data/. Recorded both choices in HUMAN-QUEUE.
- Applied Firecrawl research skill. Existing CLI 1.14.8 is authenticated but has
  zero credits. Setup scrape and one-result search both failed. Used the available
  web search/open tool as the labelled workaround, without installing tools,
  creating accounts, spending on a subscription, or accepting data-use agreements.
- Inspected primary pages/papers for AI4Leprosy, Fitzpatrick17k, DDI, SCIN,
  PAD-UFES-20, DermNet, ISIC and the WHO Skin NTDs photo library. Added a source
  register and dataset survey covering permission/access, labels, modality,
  provenance, missingness, proposed taxonomy and mapping, and combination risks.
- AI4 dataset DOI and candidate landing-page opens failed; its licence remains
  UNVERIFIED. DDI requires agreement/registration. DermNet prohibits AI use of free
  images. SCIN custom terms and Fitzpatrick original-image rights are held. PAD's
  CC BY 4.0 is documented but its labels do not supply the target positives or key
  differentials. No patient images, metadata rows, or archives downloaded.
- Accepted ADR-002: only synthetic data is approved for the current baseline.
  Models, reports and app surfaces must say PLACEHOLDER; synthetic scores and held-out
  synthetic-source results demonstrate mechanics, not clinical performance.
- Added four standard-library repository/documentation checks. Initial test run
  failed on research/README.md linking to the not-yet-created sources.md. The
  scaffold logical commit was made before the source-register follow-up; added the
  missing source register and reran the unchanged tests: all 4 passed. No tests
  deleted, weakened or skipped. No disputed test for the human queue.
- Ran bash scripts/check.sh: exit 0, RESULT PASS, ML and Android SKIPPED as expected
  at M0. This is not a claim of ML evaluation or APK production. git diff --check
  passed before commits. Tests of record/review still belong to the harness.
- Logical commits: 4e5b442 (research scaffold/licence), e683ef2 (dataset survey and
  synthetic baseline). Final notes commit records CONTINUE; M0 is incomplete.
- Next: finish the remaining six research documents, two ADRs and synthesis, then
  write a concrete M0 handoff. No review request made this iteration.
